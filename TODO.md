# Task: Fix white background on fixed menu and remove position: fixed from .fixed CSS

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Step 1: Edit css/style1.css to add global override for .fixed (set position: static !important) and ensure header.fixed has background: transparent for responsive consistency.
- [x] Step 2: Edit apropos.html to add "bg-transparent" to the header class attribute.
- [ ] Step 3: Verify the changes by opening apropos.html in a browser and checking responsive/mobile view (no white bar, header not fixed).
- [ ] Step 4: If the header structure is similar in other files (e.g., index.html, page_evenementiel.html), apply the bg-transparent change to them as well.
- [ ] Step 5: Update TODO.md to mark completion and finalize.

This TODO tracks progress on the approved plan. Updates will be made after each step.
